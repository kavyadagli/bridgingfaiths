			<h2>History</h2>
			<em></em>
<p>
Christianity begins with Jesus of Nazareth, a Jew who was born in the Roman Empire. around the age of 30, Jesus was baptized by John the Baptist and had a vision in which he received the blessing of God. This inspired his ministry of teaching, healing, and miracle-working. He spoke of the "kingdom of God," condemned religious hypocrites and interpreted the Mosaic law in new ways. He spoke before crowds of people, but also chose 12 disciples whom he taught privately. They eagerly followed him, believing him to be the long-awaited Messiah who would usher in the kingdom of God on earth.
</p>
<p>
Opposition mounted against Jesus, and he was ultimately executed by crucifixion by the Romans. But three days later, his tomb was found empty and an angel told them Jesus had risen from the dead. Jesus’ resurrection validates the Christian faith. 
</p>
<p>
The remainder of the first century AD saw the number of Jesus' followers, who were soon called "Christians," grow rapidly. Instrumental in the spread of Christianity was a man named Paul, a zealous Jew who had persecuted Christians, then converted to the faith after experiencing a vision of the risen Jesus. Taking advantage of the extensive system of Roman roads and the time of peace, Paul went on numerous missionary journeys throughout the Roman Empire. He started churches, then wrote letters back to them to offer further counsel and encouragement. Many of these letters would become part of the Christian scriptures, the "New Testament."

			<h2>Denominations</h2>
                        <p> </p>
<p>Catholic- Lead by the Pope, the Bishop of Rome. The Catholic Church teaches it is the “one holy catholic and apostolic Church founded by Jesus Christ.”</p>
<p>Baptist- The Baptist Church follows the principles that believers should be baptized upon confession of faith. Infant baptism is unscriptural and not practiced. </p>
<p>Methodist- The Methodism was founded by John Wesley. The word methodism is derived from the methodical way of studying the bible and adhering to its principles. </p>
<p>Lutheran- Lutheranism retains much of the tradition of the ancient and medieval church. It is built on the principle of justification by faith alone. </p>
<p>Presbyterian- Presbyterians adhere to two distinctive principles: a pattern of religious thought known as Reformed theology and a stress on active leadership of ministers and church members. </p>
