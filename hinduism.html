			<h2>History</h2>
			<em></em>
<p>
The history of Hinduism is unique among the world religions in that it has no founder or date of origin. While most major religions derive from new ideas taught by a charismatic leader, Hinduism is simply the religion of the people of India, which has gradually developed over four thousand years. The origins and authors of its sacred texts are largely unknown.
</p>
<p>
Although today's Hinduism differs significantly from earlier forms of Indian religion, its roots date back as far as 2000 BC, making it one of the oldest surviving religions. Because of its age, the early history of Hinduism is unclear. The most ancient writings have yet to be deciphered, so for the earliest periods scholars must rely on educated guesses based on archaeology and contemporary texts.
</p>
<p>
In 1921, archaeologists uncovered evidence of an ancient civilization along the Indus River, which today runs through northwest India into Pakistan. The so-called Indus Valley civilization (also known as the "Harappan civilization" for one of its chief cities) is thought to have originated as early as 7000 BC and to have reached is height between 2300 to 2000 BC, at which point it encompassed over 750,000 square miles and traded with Mesopotamia.

			<h2>Denominations</h2>
                        <p> </p>
<p>Catholic- Lead by the Pope, the Bishop of Rome. The Catholic Church teaches it is the “one holy catholic and apostolic Church founded by Jesus Christ.”</p>
<p>Baptist- The Baptist Church follows the principles that believers should be baptized upon confession of faith. Infant baptism is unscriptural and not practiced. </p>
<p>Methodist- The Methodism was founded by John Wesley. The word methodism is derived from the methodical way of studying the bible and adhering to its principles. </p>
<p>Lutheran- Lutheranism retains much of the tradition of the ancient and medieval church. It is built on the principle of justification by faith alone. </p>
<p>Presbyterian- Presbyterians adhere to two distinctive principles: a pattern of religious thought known as Reformed theology and a stress on active leadership of ministers and church members. </p>
